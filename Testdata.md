# Introduction

When using our [test environment](https://www.beta.twikey.com) you should be able to test anything.

This can for example include:
- Email template configuration: body, subject, sender, (custom) attributes, ..
- (Failed) payment configurations and behaviour
- Webhooks
- API: feeds, invitations, updates, ..

This article also contains the data that can be used to emulate certain outcomes.

**Caution**: Emails can be sent out, be careful when testing.  
If necessary our support can enable an option to redirect all emails (including customer emails) to avoid any accidents.  
Contact your customer success agent to enable this.

## Transactions

Every 5 minutes, a job is run to mock feedback from the bank.  
Transactions sent to the bank then receive a paid or failure state with a specific error code depending on their amount.
You can test your failed payments configuration (dunning) using the specific failure codes.

    Insufficient funds (the CAN'T-BUCKET):
    * 1 to 5 euro - MS03
    * 6 to 10 euro - AM04

    Customer refuses (the WON'T-BUCKET):
    * 11 to 15 euro - MS02
    * 16 to 20 euro - MD06

    Failure at bank (the OTHERS-BUCKET):
    * 21 - AC01
    * 22 - AC04
    * 23 - AC06
    * 24 - AC13
    * 25 - AG01
    * 26 - FF01
    * 27 - MD01
    * 28 - MD02
    * 29 - MD07
    * 30 - PY01

## B2B Mandate acceptance

Every 5 minutes, a job runs that accepts/rejects a mandate based on the last number of the iban.  
If the number is even, the B2B mandata will be accepted, but not for Belfius (BIC = GKCCBEBB) or BNP (BIC=GEBABEBB) account numbers.  
If the number is odd, the B2B mandate will be rejected.

Please find hereunder some examples for testing purposes:  
B2B Mandate accepted scenario --> BE16 6453 4897 1174  
B2B Mandate rejected scenario --> BE49 4732 1198 5171
