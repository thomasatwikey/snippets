This repository contains code samples for using the [Twikey api](https://api.twikey.com).

You can find code samples for eg.

* Creating a mandate to be signed by the customer (see specific language)
* Creating an invoice to be paid (see specific language)
* Verifying the signature of the webhook (see specific language)
* Verifying the signature of the exit url
* Calculating the OTP when using enhanced security

## Testing the API

[Postman](https://www.postman.com/) is an excellent API Testing solution, the postman file can be found in the [root of this repo](https://github.com/twikey/snippets/blob/master/postman.json) 
or download an **already customised** one from your own environment [in the API section](https://www.twikey.com/r/admin#/c/settings/api).

With this file you can test all endpoints.
